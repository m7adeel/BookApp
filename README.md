## Data Handling

### Chapter Data Structure
The application uses a structured data format for chapters stored in `data/chapters.js`. Each chapter contains:
- Title and lesson information
- Multiple exercise blocks
- Various content types (text, questions, tables, etc.)

### Exercise Types
The application supports multiple types of interactive exercises:
1. **Editable Tables**: Interactive tables where users can add/edit data
2. **Matching Exercises**: Column-based matching activities
3. **Fill-in-the-Blanks**: Text completion exercises
4. **Multiple Choice Questions**: Selection-based questions
5. **Free Answer Questions**: Open-ended responses

### Word Lookup System
The app integrates with external APIs for word definitions:
- Dictionary API for word meanings and examples
- Google Translate API for Bengali translations
- Audio pronunciation support through Expo's Audio API

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React's useState and useEffect hooks for local state management
- Expo Router for navigation and screen management
- Component-level state for interactive exercises

### Data Flow
1. Chapter data is loaded from static files
2. User interactions are handled through component state
3. External API calls for word lookup and translations
4. Persistent data handling for user progress

### Key Features
- File-based routing with Expo Router
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Dark/Light theme support
- Offline-first architecture
- Modular component structure

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Run on your preferred platform:
   - iOS Simulator
   - Android Emulator
   - Physical device through Expo Go

## Development

### Adding New Content
1. Edit `data/chapters.js` to add new chapters
2. Use the predefined block types for exercises
3. Follow the existing data structure for consistency

### Creating New Components
1. Add new components in the `components` directory
2. Register new block types in `RenderBlock.tsx`
3. Update type definitions as needed
